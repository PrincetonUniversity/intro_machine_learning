        "2.   **Convolutional Layers**: Convolution is a mathematical operation that you can think about as a weighted sum. In ML, the weights are learnable, meaning that the NN adjusts them via backpropagation. The PyTorch `conv1` and `conv2` layers convolve information from a small grid of pixels and produce a \"summary\" of what they see. There is a [wonderful Medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-convolutions-for-deep-learning-1f6f42faee1) that visualizes the process. Using their gifs, convolutional filters extract high level information from each RGB channel: ![Conv](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*8dx6nxpUh2JqvYWPadTwMQ.gif \"conv\") Information extracted from each channel is summed to a single channel: ![ConvSum](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*CYB2dyR3EhFs1xNLK8ewiA.gif \"conv-sum\") The filters are *learned* by the algorithm; the intuition is that they become \"detectors\" for certain image features. For exmaple, here's a nice example of a virtical edge detector filter (sourced from the Medium article): ![EdgeDetector](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*wju0Urp6KpAT11wktTp5Sg.png \"edge-detector\")\n",

        "pooling layers are designed to downsample images. Contrary to filters, they are *not* learnable, instead representing fixed operations. For example, a pooling layer say \"take the maximum value from each 3x3 grid of cells\".\n",
        "![Pooling](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:588/format:webp/1*BMngs93_rm2_BpJFH2mS0Q.gif \"pooling\") Pooling is used to aggregate information and shape it in a useful way for downstream learning tasks.\n",
