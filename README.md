# A Hands-On Introduction to Machine Learning

This mini-course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Part 1 introduces the machine learning process and shows participants how to train simple models. Part 2 covers model evaluation and refinement. Artificial neural networks are introduced in Part 3. A survey of different neural network architectures is presented in Part 4. The mini-course concludes with a hackathon during Part 5 where participants will work on a small, end-to-end machine learning project chosen from one of multiple domains (e.g., natural language processing, graph neural networks, physical sciences).

Attendees should have some familiarity with Python and basic calculus. This mini-course will be held during [Wintersession 2025](https://winter.princeton.edu).

## Colab Not Working?

You can run the notebooks for days 1 and 2 of this workshop using only a web browser thanks to jupyterlite. 

Step 1: Go to [https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml](https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml)

Step 2: In the file browser on the left, double click on `ML_overview_2024.ipynb` for day 1 or `Intro_Machine_Learning_Part2_2024.ipynb` for day 2 . You can then run the notebook as usual without using Colab or explicitly installing anything. The notebooks will run on your local machine.

## Undergraduate A.I. Conference at Princeton

The Princeton undergraduate student group, [Envision](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.envisionprinceton.com%2F%23page1&data=05%7C02%7Chalverson%40Princeton.EDU%7C016ce7f1c90242f8d7b508dd193e02fa%7C2ff601167431425db5af077d7791bda4%7C0%7C0%7C638694476311451151%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=vaQba4WX5uw5l0%2FmGNMU8Vkadb93MhnJs9EyfLIwSpU%3D&reserved=0), is hosting a day-long student-focused conference on February 22, 2025. The conference aims to explore the intersection of A.I., information tech policy, and ethics, with the goal of educating, inspiring action, and shaping tomorrowâ€™s leaders.
