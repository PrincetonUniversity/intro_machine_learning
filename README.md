# Introduction to Machine Learning

## About

This mini-course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Part 1 introduces the machine learning process and shows participants how to train simple models. Part 2 covers model evaluation and refinement. Artificial neural networks are introduced in Part 3. A survey of different neural network architectures is presented in Part 4. The mini-course concludes with a hackathon during Part 5 where participants will work on a small, end-to-end machine learning project chosen from one of multiple domains (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing).

Attendees should have some familiarity with Python and basic calculus.

## Live Mini-Course

The [Introduction to Machine Learning](https://cglink.me/2gi/r1938768) mini-course will be held during [Wintersession 2024](https://winter.princeton.edu) on January 16, 17, 18, 22, 23 in Lewis Library 120 at 2:00-4:00 PM.

## Day 5 Hackathon

- Large Language Models: This session introduces the basics of language modeling using the transformer architecture. Participants will learn how to download and fine-tune an LLM using the Hugging Face library.
- Diffusion models: Learn about diffusion models (e.g., DALL-E 2) then build one and train a generative model for images.
- Computer vision: Learn more about CNNs, classify dogs versus cats using a simple CNN, and use transfer learning with an advanced CNN (ResNet-50) to classify dogs versus cats.

## Colab Not Working?

You can run the notebooks for days 1 and 2 of this workshop using only a web browser thanks to jupyterlite. 

Step 1: Go to [https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml](https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml)

Step 2: In the file browser on the left, double click on `ML_overview_2024.ipynb` for day 1 or `Intro_Machine_Learning_Part2_2024.ipynb` for day 2 . You can then run the notebook as usual without using Colab or explicitly installing anything. The notebooks will run on your local machine.
