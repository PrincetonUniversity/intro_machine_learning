# A Hands-On Introduction to Machine Learning

This mini-course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Part 1 introduces the machine learning process and shows participants how to train simple models. Part 2 covers model evaluation and refinement. Artificial neural networks are introduced in Part 3. A survey of different neural network architectures is presented in Part 4. The mini-course concludes with specialized sessions during Part 5 where participants will choose from one of multiple domains (natural language processing, graph neural networks, physical sciences).

Attendees should have some familiarity with Python and basic calculus. This mini-course will be held during [Wintersession 2025](https://winter.princeton.edu).

## Colab Not Working?

You can run the notebooks for days 1 and 2 of this workshop using only a web browser thanks to jupyterlite. 

Step 1: Go to [https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml](https://jdh4.github.io/intro-ml)

Step 2: In the file browser on the left, double click on `ML_overview_2024.ipynb` for day 1 or `Intro_Machine_Learning_Part2_2024.ipynb` for day 2 . You can then run the notebook as usual without using Colab or explicitly installing anything. The notebooks will run on your local machine.
