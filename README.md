# Introduction to Machine Learning

## About

This mini-course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning. Part 1 introduces the machine learning process and shows participants how to train simple models. Part 2 covers model evaluation and refinement. Artificial neural networks are introduced in Part 3. A survey of different neural network architectures is presented in Part 4. The mini-course concludes with a hackathon during Part 5 where participants will work on a small, end-to-end machine learning project chosen from one of multiple domains (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing).

Attendees should have some familiarity with Python and basic calculus.
